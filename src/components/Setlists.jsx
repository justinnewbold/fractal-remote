 * the setlist they step through. They are one sheet because they are one
 * decision — you pick a setlist and the songs in it are right there under it,
 * in order, to be fixed on the spot when the running order changes at the
 * venue.
 *
 * Everything here writes straight to storage and says nothing back: the lib
 * fires a change event on every write, and Play re-reads. So this sheet never
 * holds a copy of the lists that could drift from the one the buttons use.
 *
 * `slots` is the picker's own list — every slot on the unit with whatever name
 * has been read for it — so a song reads as "045 Rhythm Crunch" here the same
 * as it does there.
