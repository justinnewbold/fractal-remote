 * "Add volume slider to the play screen to quickly turn volume up or down."
 *
 * It moves the Output block's Level — the whole preset's volume, the control a
 * soundperson means when they say "give me a bit less". It was reachable, on
 * Edit, as a read-only number at the bottom of the Output block's sheet; the
 * only way to actually change it was the knob on the unit. A slider here is
 * what the front-panel knob is: one thing, the right size for a thumb, that
 * does not need looking at.
 *
 * lib/volume.js says why the Output level is the player's to move when the
 * model may not, and how a drag becomes writes the port can keep up with.
