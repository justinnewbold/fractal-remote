/**
 * A rotary control.
 *
 * Fractal's editors use knobs because the hardware does, and because a knob
 * shows where a value sits in its range at a glance in a way a number never
 * does. The arc is that: sweep from the 7 o'clock start to the current
 * position.
 *
 * Dragging is vertical only. Circular tracking sounds right and isn't — the
 * pointer leaves the knob, and small movements near the centre produce huge
 * jumps. Every hardware editor uses vertical drag for the same reason.
 *
 * The listeners are mouse and touch on the window, not pointer events with
 * capture. Capture is the right shape for this and WebKit doesn't deliver it:
 * on iOS, once a captured touch moves off the element the pointermove stream
 * stops, and a vertical drag leaves a 58px knob almost immediately — which
 * shipped as knobs that wouldn't turn at all on an iPhone. Window listeners
 * hear the whole drag wherever the finger goes. Each drag stores the
 * identifier of the touch that started it and reads only that touch, so a
 * finger on each of two knobs turns two knobs, not one finger's knob twice.
 *
 * And the touch is armed in a native listener, synchronously, rather than by
 * React. Two things made that necessary, and together they cost the knobs a
 * second round of not turning on an iPhone:
 *
 *   - React registers touchstart and touchmove on the root as PASSIVE, so
 *     preventDefault inside a React handler is ignored. iOS decides on the
 *     first move whether a gesture is a scroll, and nothing had told it no.
 *   - The move listener was added by an effect that ran after a state change,
 *     which is a render too late: by then iOS had already claimed the gesture
 *     and cancelled the touch out from under the drag.
 *
 * So touchstart is bound to the element itself with passive:false, it calls
 * preventDefault there, and it registers the move listeners in the same tick.
 * The drag lives in a ref for that reason — nothing about starting one waits on
 * a render. The state flag exists only for what is drawn.
