/**
 * Where saving lives now: the top right of the screen, in the masthead.
 *
 * This control has moved three times, each for a reason worth remembering. It
 * started as a panel at the foot of the page that existed only while the app
 * believed something had changed — out of sight and intermittent. Then a bar
 * pinned to the bottom of the viewport: always findable, but a permanent
 * floater eating a strip of every screen, which on a phone is a strip you feel.
 * Then the top bar, with an "Options" button beside it holding name, slot and
 * revert.
 *
 * Now it is one button, and it opens a sheet rather than writing.
 *
 * That last change is not only about clearing a button out of a crowded bar.
 * This app has argued from the beginning that a slot overwrite must not sit
 * within reach of a mis-tap mid-song — and yet Save wrote, immediately, on one
 * press, to whatever slot was loaded. The sheet is where that gets settled:
 * the write is still two taps from anywhere, but the second tap is on a button
 * that names the slot, next to the list of what is in it.

   * and useless after ten minutes of work on a tone with the amp across the room.
   *
   * The request now travels the host's document store — the one road the relay
   * leaves open — and the page at the Mac carries it out. So the button saves,
   * and waits for word back rather than claiming a slot was written the moment
   * it was asked for.
   *
   * It used to SAY who does the writing, in its label: "Save at the computer".
   * "All changes made on the phone can be saved, and should be able to be
   * saved to the unit." They can, and that label read as a job to go and do

   * everyone looks at said nothing, and the word that did was the smallest
   * thing in the bar (and hidden on phones). Now: quiet "Saved" when there
   * is nothing to save, amber "Save" when there is.
   *
   * "Saved" only once something actually was. `dirty` answers "is there
   * anything unsaved", which is not the same question — on a preset freshly
   * loaded, or one just generated and written to the unit but never put in a
   * slot, there is nothing pending and nothing saved either, and the button
   * claimed the second. "This says 'Saved' when there is nothing saved yet. It
   * should say SAVE if it hasn't been saved yet."
   *
   * And then it said "Save" instead, on a preset nobody had touched, which is
   * the same fault wearing the other word: a button offering to do a thing
   * there is no thing to do. "Only show the Save button is there something to
   * save. I literally just loaded a brand new scene and it still says save."
   *
   * So it is not a label any more, it is a presence. Nothing pending, nothing
   * in flight, nothing just done — no button. The bar on a phone is four
   * controls wide and every one of them has to be earning it.
