/**
 * The chain, as a chain.
 *
 * This was a 4x12 grid of cells 940px wide, laid out on a canvas that scrolled
 * sideways on every screen and needed drag-and-drop — which does nothing at all
 * on iOS — to move anything. On a 390px phone you saw three cells of forty-eight
 * and had to scroll to find the one you wanted, and every error printed at the
 * top of a long page, far above the fold, so a tap that failed looked like a tap
 * that did nothing. The report was blunt and correct: "the rest you can't really
 * add anything or change anything… let's rethink that whole thing."
 *
 * So: one lane per row of the grid, each lane a vertical list of what is
 * actually in it, in signal order, with the free cells between them shown as
 * gaps you can tap. Nothing is hidden — the column number is on every card, and
 * a preset with parallel rows shows a lane each — but nothing is drawn that
 * isn't there either, which is what turned forty-eight cells into five.
 *
 * Tap a block for what you can do to it; tap a gap to put something in it. Every
 * answer, and every failure, appears in that same row, under your thumb.
 *
 * Two things about writing here are worth knowing. Placement writes structure
 * rather than values, and that part of ForgeFX is worked out from the protocol
 * rather than confirmed on hardware — so a bad write mangles a preset rather
 * than mis-setting a knob. And this unit family answers `ok:false` to writes
 * that landed (documented twice in this repo), which is why nothing here treats
 * that answer as a failure: it re-reads the chain from the unit instead and
 * lets you look.
