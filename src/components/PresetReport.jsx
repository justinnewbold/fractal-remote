/**
 * Ask the unit everything about the preset in front of you, and say what in
 * it would keep it quiet.
 *
 * "Can we set up a way to read the parameters of the current scene to
 * investigate why there is no sound on any of the scenes in this preset?"
 *
 * Every fact here was already readable and none of it was ever gathered: the
 * blocks with their positions and what is wired into them, whether each one is
 * on in this scene and on which channel, every parameter with its value and
 * range, and the routing grid in the unit's own words. lib/presetReport.js
 * does the judging; this does the reading, on a tap rather than on a timer,
 * because it is a dozen round trips down a port that carries the audio.
 *
 * The grid goes in raw. Block placement is the part of ForgeFX worked out from
 * the protocol rather than confirmed against hardware, so the exact shape of
 * what it reports is the answer to the question this panel exists to ask, and
 * summarising it would throw that away.
