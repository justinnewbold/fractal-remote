/**
 * Telling us something is broken, or asking for something.
 *
 * Two taps and a sentence. Nothing here asks for a title, a category, steps to
 * reproduce, or an account — every one of those is a reason not to bother, and
 * the report nobody sends is worth nothing. What the app knows about itself is
 * attached automatically, which is the part a person could not supply anyway.
 *
 * THE LOG IS THE PART TO BE CAREFUL WITH, and the care is all in the shape of
 * this screen rather than in any warning:
 *
 * - It goes with a bug and never with an idea. Somebody asking for a bigger
 *   tuner has not offered a transcript of their evening, and the form does not
 *   quietly take one. The switch is not even drawn on that side.
 * - It is gathered when Send is pressed and at no other moment. Nothing is
 *   collected while somebody types, so a report half-written and abandoned
 *   leaves no copy of anything anywhere.
 * - It can be looked at first, in full, by the same two functions that send
 *   it — so what is shown cannot drift from what goes.
 * - And it can be turned off, on the one screen where it would otherwise be a
 *   thing that happens to you rather than a thing you did.
