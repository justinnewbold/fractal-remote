 * When the tab is running a build that no longer exists.
 *
 * A phone keeps a tab alive for days. iOS doesn't re-fetch a page you return
 * to — it restores it from memory — so a browser that was opened last week is
 * still running last week's bundle, and no amount of deploying changes that.
 * This cost a round of bug reports against code that had already been fixed:
 * the diagnostics said one version, the deploy was five ahead, and both of us
 * were looking at different apps.
 *
 * The check is the cheapest honest one available: ask the server for the page
 * we were loaded from and compare the hashed script it names against the one
 * this document actually loaded. No build step, no version endpoint to keep in
 * sync — the filename IS the version, and it changes exactly when the code
 * does.

 * Ten minutes was too long to be believed.
 *
 * "Doesn't look like the push went through somehow, the PWA has not updated
 * yet, still on version 7.160.0" — said about a deploy that was live and
 * correct. From the outside a ten-minute gap between deploying and being told
 * is indistinguishable from a deploy that never happened, and what it costs is
 * a bug report against code that is already fixed. A minute is still one small
 * no-store request for a page of about a kilobyte, and only while the app is
 * in front of somebody.
