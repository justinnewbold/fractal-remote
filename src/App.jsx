        The chain, and everything that changes it, on a phone.

        "On the PWA we need to be able to see what chain was written or what
        chain is currently on a setting."

        The Edit screen where this lives is deliberately unreachable on a phone
        — see BENCH in components/Screens.jsx, and the same rule the phone apps
        in mobile/ have always had: a generate button within reach of a stage
        tap is a hazard. That rule is about what a SWIPE lands on in the dark,
        not about what the app is capable of showing. Nothing here is one
        gesture from the stage screen; it is behind the gear, which is where
        somebody goes when they have stopped playing and want to look at
        something.

        The same contents as the Edit screen, in a sheet, so there is one chain
        editor in this app rather than a second one written for a small screen.

          fallen off the end. Nothing on it said what state anything was in
          until a door was opened.

          Now: the version line he likes at the top, then seven rows, each
          carrying the one fact you would have opened it for, each opening its
          own page. Rename stays on the Unit page beside Read the unit again —
          "move the rename presets and scenes button to the settings menu" —
          History moved in with the AI's work, the theme switch in with the
          Play screen, and the real amp names got a row of their own.

          THE UNLOCK PAGE, in the phone paywall's own words.

          Every sentence here is copied from mobile/src/screens/Paywall.js, and
          test/both-ends.mjs holds them to it: the same offer, worded the same
          way at both ends, and none of it written fresh for the browser. What
          is left out is what a browser cannot do — Restore asks Apple or
          Google, and there is neither here; a purchase made on a phone already
          shows as paid on this page, through the account.

          The checkout itself is RevenueCat's, drawn over this page by the
          library. It takes real cards: webPurchase.js is on the live key since
          the sandbox checkout was walked through end to end.
