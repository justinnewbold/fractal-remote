/**
 * Which end of the phone remote this is, and whether the other end is there.
 *
 * The main purpose of this app is to be a phone remote for the unit on the
 * Mac, and until this file the app could not say honestly whether that was
 * working. "Connected" meant a channel had been joined — true with the Mac
 * off and nothing answering, false for a phone happily driving the rig over
 * wifi. The only honest test of a link is whether the far end answers, so
 * that is the only thing that turns the lamp green here.
 *
 * One object, one subscription, the way `subscribeRemoteState` works:
 *
 *   role    — 'mac' (the machine with the cable), 'wifi' (a phone that opened
 *             the app served from the Mac), 'remote' (a phone on the web app),
 *             'unknown' until asked.
 *   link    — 'signed-out' | 'joining' | 'no-answer' | 'connected' | 'off'
 *   account — who is signed in here, or null
 *   hostOn  — mac role: the Mac is listening for a phone
 *   macName — remote role: what the phone shows once the Mac has answered
 *   macVersion — remote role: which Mac app answered, for the debug report
 *   since   — when `link` last changed, so a screen can wait out a blip
 *
 * The pure parts — which role this is, what state that makes, what to say
 * about it, how long to wait before asking again — take their facts as
 * arguments and are tested in node. The effectful part, `bootLink`, is the one
 * place those facts are gathered, and it imports the device module lazily
 * because that module is not importable outside a browser.
