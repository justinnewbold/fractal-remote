/**
 * The colours Fractal paints its blocks, so this app's blocks match the unit.
 *
 * The point is recognition on a dark stage: on the AM4's own screen the drive
 * is red and the delay is blue, and a screen pretending to be that hardware
 * should agree with it.
 *
 * Two grades of confidence live here, deliberately. drive, amp, delay and
 * reverb are read straight off an AM4's display. Everything else carries the
 * hue this app has always used for that family — continuity for families the
 * photo doesn't show — and is meant to be tuned by holding the app next to the
 * unit, not defended.
 *
 * Keys are the slugs ForgeFX reports. Unknown families get the neutral the app
 * used everywhere before colours existed.
