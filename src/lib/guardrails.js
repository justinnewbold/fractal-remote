/**
 * Parameters that can silence a preset.
 *
 * A block's output Level reads like a tone control by name — "Amp1 Level" sits
 * in the same list as Bass, Mid and Treble — so a generator will happily set it
 * to -60 dB while every other value is musically correct. The result is a preset
 * that looks right and makes no sound. Nothing downstream can catch that,
 * because -60 dB is inside the parameter's legal range.
 *
 * The first answer was to withhold every one of them. That cost more than it
 * saved: "I told the AI the amp should be louder when it's on than when it's
 * off and it told me I was wrong." The one control that does that was invisible
 * to it, so instead of saying it could not, it disputed the premise.
 *
 * So the rule is split. Balance, Pan, Output and the rest are routing and stay
 * the player's alone. A block's own Level moves, but only within a window
 * around where it already sits, and never into the bottom of its range — a
 * nudge, not a reset. That makes "louder for the lead" reachable while the
 * silent preset stays impossible.

 *
 * Measured from where the control sits now rather than from the middle of its

 * has been set low on purpose should not be dragged back to the centre.
 *
 * The two ends used to be worked out independently, and on a control already at

 * 0-10 produced a floor of 2 and a ceiling of 1.5, so nothing at all could be

 * that made it the one value that could never move.

 * is no value of anything here that lets a write make a block quieter than the
