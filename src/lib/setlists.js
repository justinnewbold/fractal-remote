/**
 * Setlists, and what Previous / Next on the stage screen step through.
 *
 * Previous and Next walked the unit's slots one at a time: 44, 45, 46. That is
 * the right order for a unit and the wrong order for a night — the songs in a
 * set are never in the slots next to each other, so getting from the opener
 * to the second song was a trip through the preset list mid-set, on a phone,
 * in the dark.
 *
 * So the two buttons take an ORDER, and the order comes from one of three
 * places:
 *
 *   'all'      the slots, as before — 44, 45, 46.
 *   'starred'  the presets starred in the picker, in slot order.
 *   a setlist  a named, ordered list built for a night: opener first.
 *
 * Starred is a set of presets, not a sequence, so it steps in slot order and
 * is the quick answer for someone who has not built a setlist. A setlist is
 * the sequence itself.
 *
 * Kept per unit, like the stars in presetMarks: slot 4 on an FM3 and slot 4 on
 * an AM4 are different sounds, and a setlist of one must not play as the other.
 *
 * This browser only, for the same reason the stars are. A setlist built at
 * the Mac is not on the phone until it is built there too — the sheet that
 * builds one is the same on both.
 *
 * Everything that decides is pure and takes lists; only the last few functions
 * touch storage, and they take it as an argument so the tests can hand in a
 * Map.
