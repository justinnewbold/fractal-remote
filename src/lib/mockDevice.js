 *
 * Two reasons this exists. Development shouldn't require sitting at the amp,
 * and more importantly the write semantics that cost an evening to discover are
 * reproduced here deliberately:
 *
 *   - writes take normalised 0-1, reads return real units
 *   - an out-of-range write does not error, it clamps and reports success
 *   - a model swap resets that block's parameters and can change their ranges
 *
 * That last set is the point. Every one of those failures looked like success
 * from the response alone, and none of them were catchable without hardware
 * until now.
