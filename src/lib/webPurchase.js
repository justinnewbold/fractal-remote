/**
 * Buying the unlock from a browser, or from the computer app.
 *
 * "We already decided that we ARE gonna offer the purchases on the desktop apps
 * and the web app." The phone buys through Apple or Google; this buys through
 * RevenueCat Web Billing, which takes the card through his own Stripe account.
 * The Mac, Windows and Linux apps load this same build, so this is their way
 * to pay as well.
 *
 * THE SAME UNLOCK, NOT A SECOND ONE. It is filed under the signed-in account's
 * id — exactly the id the phone gives RevenueCat's logIn — and it grants the
 * same `full` entitlement. So a card taken here unlocks the phone the moment
 * that phone signs in, and the relay's table learns of it from the webhook.
 *
 * WHICH KEY: the live one. Web Billing has two public keys. The sandbox key
 * takes Stripe's test cards and moves no money; the production key takes
 * real ones. It shipped on sandbox until somebody had walked the checkout
 * end to end — he did, a new account made on the website and paid for:
 * "Payment on web working. You can go ahead and set it live instead of the
 * sandbox." Going back is one line: WEB_KEY to SANDBOX_KEY. Both are public
 * by design, like the phone's appl_ and goog_ keys.
