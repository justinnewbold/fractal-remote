/**
 * What a block offers, kept between requests.
 *
 * Reading the schema walks every block one at a time down a single serial port,
 * which is the slowest thing this app does. Doing it before every sentence made
 * conversation feel like batch work.
 *
 * The three pieces age differently, so they're cached differently:
 *
 *   rosters and help    never change while a unit is attached
 *   parameter values    change constantly, but usually because we changed them
 *   parameter ranges    change when a model is swapped
 *
 * So values are patched in place after a verified write rather than re-read, and
 * the whole parameter cache is dropped on anything structural. Anything that
 * might have moved under us — a knob turned on the unit itself — is handled by
 * `force`, which the manual refresh uses.
