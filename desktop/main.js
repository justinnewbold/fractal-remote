/**
 * The Mac app: open it, and your phone can reach the unit.
 *
 * Deliberately thin. Everything worth getting right — where ForgeFX is, which
 * port, what the phone should scan — lives in lib/host.mjs, shared with
 * `npm run serve` and tested without a Mac. What is left here is the part that
 * genuinely needs Electron: a window, a menu-bar item, and a child process.
 *
 * It lives in the menu bar as well as the dock because it is a service with a
 * status. Closing its window quits it — "the app does not close out all the
 * way when you click the close button" was the report, and an app that looks
 * closed while still holding the unit is worse than one you have to reopen.
 *
 * ForgeFX runs as a child process rather than in-process. Importing it is the
 * path it documents, and Axis takes it — but it opens a serial port through
 * native modules, and a native module that crashes in-process takes the whole
 * app with it. A child can die and be reported. Worth revisiting once this has
 * run on real hardware for a while; not worth guessing at from a container.
