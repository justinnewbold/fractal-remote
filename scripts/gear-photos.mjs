/**
 * The photo list the app reads, built from the one the licences live in.
 *
 * public/gear/sources.csv is the record of WHY we are allowed to use each
 * photograph — where it came from, who took it, under what licence. That file
 * is the thing a person checks, and it stays a spreadsheet for exactly that
 * reason. This turns it into something the app can import.
 *
 * NOTHING SHIPS WITHOUT A RIGHTS URL, and that rule lives here rather than in
 * a reviewer's head. Every CC BY and CC BY-SA licence requires the
 * photographer be named wherever the picture appears, so a row that cannot say
 * who took it is a row we cannot legally show — and this refuses to emit one.
 * The last batch of 200 was thrown away over exactly this.
 *
 * A file on disk with no row is also an error rather than a warning. It would
 * sit in the deployed site, reachable by anybody who guessed the address,
 * with no record of where it came from.
 *
 *   npm run gear:photos
