 * The web app imports these directly, so it cannot drift by construction. The
 * phone app cannot: Metro would have to be pointed outside its own directory,
 * and an EAS build that uploads only `mobile/` would then fail at bundle time —
 * on a build machine, minutes in, for a reason that looks nothing like "a file
 * moved". Reaching outside is the kind of thing that works on the laptop it was
 * written on.
 *
 * So the phone gets a copy, and the copy is generated rather than edited. Run
 * this after touching a source; `npm test` regenerates every one of them in
 * memory and fails if what is on disk differs, so a stale copy cannot be
 * merged.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE is anything where the two apps disagreeing is a fault
 * rather than a difference. The relay allowlist was the first: allowing
 * something the host refuses turns a friendly sentence into a bare status code
 * mid-song. The generation rules are the rest of it — a phone that validates a
 * tone by looser rules than the Mac is a phone that writes something the Mac
 * would have refused, into a rig somebody is about to play.
