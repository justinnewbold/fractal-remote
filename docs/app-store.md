# Getting onto the App Store

**Live on the App Store since 8 October 2026** (build 24, 1.86.83):
https://apps.apple.com/app/id6812916461. Everything below still applies to
every new version sent for review.

Everything App Store Connect asks for, answered. Copy the fields straight
across; the notes say why an answer is what it is where that matters.

**The one that gets apps like this rejected** is at the bottom, under *Review
notes*. Read that one even if you skip the rest.

## The listing

| Field | Limit | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | 30 | `Fractal Remote` |
| **Subtitle** | 30 | `Run your rig from your phone` |

### Promotional text (170, editable any time without a new build)

```
Your setlist, your scenes and your whole chain on the phone in your hand —
and a tuner you can read from the back of the stage.
```

### Keywords (100, commas, no spaces after them)

```
guitar,amp,fm3,fm9,axefx,am4,vp4,preset,scene,setlist,tuner,rig,stage,pedalboard
```

Naming the hardware you work with is ordinary and allowed — it is how someone
searching for it finds you. It is also why the affiliation disclaimer matters:
the listing says which gear this works with, and never implies it comes from
the people who make that gear.

### Description

```
Fractal Remote puts your rig on your phone.

Plug your Fractal unit into a computer, open Fractal Remote on your phone, and
everything the unit can do is in your hand — from the back of the stage, from
the couch, or from the other side of the room.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

• Change presets and scenes, with names you can actually read
• See your whole signal chain and switch blocks in or out
• Tune up, with a display readable at a distance in the dark
• Build setlists and star the presets you reach for
• Reach for a knob and change it without walking back to the rack

ONE ACCOUNT, BOTH ENDS

Sign the phone and the computer app into the same account and they find each
other — at home, at rehearsal, or at the venue. Your setlists and starred
presets follow you to any device.

BUILT FOR A STAGE, NOT A DESK

Big targets you can hit without looking. A screen that stays readable when the
lights go down. Nothing that needs two hands.

FREE TO TRY

The demo is free, with every screen working on a simulated unit. A one-time
purchase unlocks control of your own rig.

WHAT YOU NEED

• A Fractal Audio unit — FM3, FM9, Axe-Fx, AM4 or VP4
• A Mac or Windows computer with a USB cable to the unit
• The free Fractal Remote app for that computer, from fractal.newbold.cloud

JUST LOOKING?

Tap "Try the demo" on the first screen. It is a simulated FM3 — every screen
works, with no hardware at all.

Fractal Remote is an independent app. It is in no way affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by Fractal Audio Systems, Inc.

## Screenshots

Required for **6.9" iPhone** (1290 × 2796 or 1320 × 2868). Because
`supportsTablet` is on, **13" iPad** (2064 × 2752) is required too — turning
tablet support off is the alternative and would be a worse app.

Up to 10 each; 3–5 is plenty. Take them **in the demo**, so every screen is
full of real-looking presets rather than "no computer".

Worth showing, in this order:

1. The stage screen with a preset up and scenes along the bottom
2. The chain, with blocks on and off
3. The tuner
4. A setlist
5. Setup, showing it connected

## App Privacy (the nutrition label)

Answer **Yes** to collecting data, then declare exactly these. Everything is
**"used for App Functionality"**, and **nothing is used for tracking** — say No
to the tracking question, because it is true and it keeps you out of App
Tracking Transparency entirely.

| Data type | Collected | Linked to the user | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contact Info → **Email Address** | Yes | Yes | Account sign-in, and answering a support message if they leave one |
| User Content → **Other User Content** | Yes | Yes | Setlists, so they follow you between devices |
| Identifiers → **User ID** | Yes | Yes | The account id that ties your setlists to you |
| Diagnostics → **Other Diagnostic Data** | Yes | Yes | The debug log, and only when somebody presses Send on a bug report |
| Purchases → **Purchase History** | Yes | Yes | The unlock. RevenueCat keeps the purchase record so it follows the account to other devices |

Do **not** declare location, contacts, photos, audio, search history, browsing
history or advertising data. None are collected — and the
privacy page says so, so a wrong answer here contradicts a published document.

**Why the log is declared even though it is opt-in:** Apple asks what the app
is *capable* of sending, not what it usually sends. Declaring it and being able
to point at a policy that explains it is the strong position.

## Age rating

**Social media features: No.** From September 2026 every update is asked this
in the age-rating questionnaire. The app has no feed, no profiles and nothing
one user can show another.

**4+.** Every question in the questionnaire is None / No — including the newer
ones about parental controls, age assurance, unrestricted web access,
user-generated content, messaging, advertising, and medical or wellness
topics. Links to the downloads page open in the phone's own browser; that is
not unrestricted web access inside the app. There is no user
generated content shown to other people, no web browsing, no gambling, no
contests and no messaging between users — a bug report goes to one inbox and
is never shown to anyone else.

---

## Content rights

**Yes, it contains third-party content** — the names of Fractal Audio's
hardware (FM3, FM9, Axe-Fx, AM4, VP4) and pictures of those units. Answer
**Yes** to having the rights only if the unit pictures are photos you took or
were given permission to use; the names are used only to say which hardware
the app works with, which the affiliation line in the description covers.

---

## Export compliance

**Already handled — nothing to do.** The app uses HTTPS and nothing else,
which is standard encryption and exempt, and `mobile/app.json` already carries
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` in its `infoPlist`. That answers the
question automatically on every submission rather than asking you each time.

---

## Only you can do these

- **Paid Applications Agreement** — App Store Connect → Business. Until it is
  signed and active, a paid app cannot be sold at all.
- **Banking and tax forms** — same place. These take the longest, sometimes
  days, so start them before you need them.
- **The app record itself** — bundle ID `cloud.newbold.fractalremote`.
- **Pricing and Availability** — App Store Connect → the app → Pricing and
  Availability: price **Free**, and the countries it is sold in. Without it an
  approved app says *Ready for Distribution* and still appears nowhere — which
  is exactly what happened on 8 October 2026. The EU asks for a trader-status
  declaration (Digital Services Act) before it will list the app there.

## Review notes

**Paste this into App Review Information → Notes.** This is the paragraph that
decides whether the app is rejected as non-functional.

```
This app is a remote control for Fractal Audio guitar hardware. Normally it
connects to a computer that has the guitar unit plugged into it over USB.

You will not have that hardware, so the app includes a full demo mode that
needs nothing but the phone, and no account:

  1. Tap "Get started"
  2. Tap "Got it"
  3. Tap "Start free demo"
  4. Choose any unit, then tap "Play with ..."

That loads a simulated unit with twelve presets and named scenes. Every
screen works — presets, scenes, the signal chain, the tuner, tap tempo,
setlists, settings. Nothing in the demo reaches real hardware.

The demo is free and needs no account. An account is used for one thing
only: joining this phone to a computer that has the guitar unit plugged
into it.

A demo account for the signed-in screens is in App Review Information
(Sign-in required).

Deleting an account (Guideline 5.1.1(v)): tap the gear at the top right for
Settings, tap the account card at the top, then Delete account, then
"Delete my account". It deletes the account and everything stored under it
straight away. To try it, please create a new account rather than deleting
the demo account, which the rest of the review needs.

Hardware (Guideline 2.1): a video filmed on an iPhone with a real FM3 on
screen, from the first pairing through the whole workflow, is linked in App
Review Information.

Apple Watch: the watch app comes with the iPhone app. It works in the demo
too. Start the demo as above, keep the Play screen open on the iPhone, then
open Fractal on the watch. Swipe up or down between Scenes, Pedals, Presets
and Tuner.
```

**Why this matters more than anything else here.** A reviewer opens the app,
sees "no computer", and has no way to know there is anything behind it. The
demo is three taps in, but only if somebody tells them it is there.

**AND WHY IT IS WRITTEN OUT TAP BY TAP.** The paragraph that used to be here
said *"On the first screen, tap 'Just looking? Try the demo'"* — and the trap
is that this was a REAL button. It sat on the sign-in screen, which is not the
first screen: a fresh install opens the walkthrough, and the sign-in screen is
only reached after it. So a reviewer looked for a button that exists, on a
screen that does not have it, and had nothing to go on. Right button, wrong
screen, same rejection.

It also claimed the app worked "on a local network" without an account, and
that signing in was only for reaching a computer from outside your home wifi.
Both stopped being true when pairing became account-only.

Store copy goes stale silently, because nothing in the build reads it. Two
tests read it instead — one holds every label here against the walkthrough's
own strings, the other against the sign-in screen's — and both read only the
fenced block above, because this paragraph quotes the wording it replaced and
a search of the whole file finds the explanation rather than the instruction.
