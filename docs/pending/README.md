# Finished work waiting for a build

Changes here are done and tested, but they touch the built-in part of the app
(native code), so merging them stops over-the-air updates reaching phones
until a new Expo build is installed. They wait here, as patches against main,
until Justin agrees to the next build.

When the build is agreed:

    git apply docs/pending/<name>.patch      # in the order of the table below
    (cd mobile && npm install)                # when a patch adds a package
    npm run sync:rules
    npm run fingerprint -- --write
    npm test

then bump the version, delete the patch file in the same change, and build.

| Patch | What it does | Moves |
|---|---|---|

Nothing is waiting. The last patch here, `bluetooth-beta.patch`, went into
1.87.1 on 10 October 2026, when Justin said "If Bluetooth is ready, let's get
it submitted": Bluetooth (beta) for everyone who has unlocked the app, with a
beta note, the parts and how they plug in, and the setup guide at
fractal.newbold.cloud/bluetooth.html. What it carried, and why each part is
the way it is, is in that change's pull request and in the comments of the
files themselves (mobile/src/lib/bluetooth.js, bleWire.js, bleLink.js,
mobile/src/screens/Bluetooth.js, shared/bluetooth-gear.mjs).

Still true from the work it carried:

- **Decided, 9 Oct: the unlock check over Bluetooth stays as it is for now.**
  It fails open, like the rest of the app: a phone may drive a unit over
  Bluetooth when it has paid OR when the store cannot answer (no signal, the
  store not reached yet, nothing to sell, or a copy that cannot take
  payments, such as the APK on GitHub). Justin chose this ("Leave it as is
  for now") over requiring a remembered "paid" answer. Ask again only if he
  raises it.
- Left alone, with the reason: the FM9's and Axe-Fx III's extra blocks
  (Amp 2, Cab 2, Drive 3 and so on) do not show as pedals over Bluetooth.
  The fix needs their block numbers, which are not in this repository and
  nobody here has either unit to check them against; a wrong guess could put
  an output block on the pedal board.
