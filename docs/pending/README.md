# Finished work waiting for a build

Changes here are done and tested, but they touch the built-in part of the app
(native code), so merging them stops over-the-air updates reaching phones
until a new Expo build is installed. They wait here, as patches against main,
until Justin agrees to the next build.

When the build is agreed:

    git apply docs/pending/<name>.patch      # in the order of the table below
    (cd mobile && npm install)                # when a patch adds a package
    npm run sync:rules
    npm run fingerprint -- --write
    npm test

then bump the version, delete the patch file in the same change, and build.

| Patch | What it does | Moves |
|---|---|---|

Nothing is waiting: the last three (wake-on-tap, metronome sound and watch tap, the light-ground watch icon) went into the build after Apple refused build 23.
