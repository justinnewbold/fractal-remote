# Finished work waiting for a build

Changes here are done and tested, but they touch the built-in part of the app
(native code), so merging them stops over-the-air updates reaching phones
until a new Expo build is installed. They wait here, as patches against main,
until Justin agrees to the next build.

When the build is agreed:

    git apply docs/pending/<name>.patch
    npm run fingerprint -- --write
    npm test

then bump the version, delete the patch file in the same change, and build.

| Patch | What it does | Moves |
|---|---|---|
| `wake-on-tap.patch` | The phone can stay locked in a pocket: each watch tap wakes the app in the background to send the change (PR #641's first version, 1b4d304). | iOS + watch |
