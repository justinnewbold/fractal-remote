 * never finds it and cannot say why. A phone whose allowlist has drifted from
 * the host's either refuses something that works or promises something that
 * doesn't. And a phone that decodes a gzip frame wrongly reports "your Mac
 * didn't answer" about a Mac that answered perfectly.
 *
 * The mobile app is not importable by node — it is JSX and React Native — so
 * these read the source where they have to, exactly as structure.mjs does for
 * App.jsx, and import the plain modules where they can.

     *   React  RCTFatal + 568 (RCTAssert.m:147)

     * A ReferenceError thrown while rendering is not an error message on a
     * screen. It is the process aborting, mid-set, on the one screen somebody
     * would be opening between two songs.
     *
     * There is no linter in this repository, and CI runs the tests and two

     * That one pass covers both, which is worth saying because it was checked
     * rather than assumed — an element's name is a reference like any other, so
     * <Ghost /> comes out of the same list `useEffect` does. The hand-written
