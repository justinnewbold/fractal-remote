 * reported by the person waiting for it. `entitlement` is different. It decides
 * whether somebody who paid gets to drive their rig from a computer, and every
 * way it can fail is silent — a wrong answer looks exactly like a right one to
 * everybody except the person locked out of a thing they bought.
