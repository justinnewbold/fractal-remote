/**
 * The same app at both ends, or a written reason why not.
 *
 * There are four things you can install and two sets of screens. The Mac app
 * loads the browser's own build, so it cannot drift from the web by
 * construction, and one Expo project builds both phones, so those two cannot
 * drift from each other. What is left is the real seam: `src/` and `mobile/`,
 * two screens written by hand for the same rig.
 *
 * Nothing used to watch that seam. The chain editor was fixed on the phone in
 * 7.311.0 and did not reach the browser until 7.320.0 — nine versions of a
 * screen that existed on one end and not the other, with nothing failing, and
 * the only way anyone found out was by opening the app and not seeing it.
 *
 * So: every button either exists at both ends, or is written down here with the
 * reason it does not. A new button on one side fails this test until somebody
 * says which it is. That is the whole mechanism — it does not decide anything,
 * it refuses to let the decision go unmade.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, deliberately. A label built out of a variable is skipped
 * rather than guessed at, and so is a busy caption ("Removing…"). An extractor
 * that cries wolf gets an allowlist that becomes a junk drawer, and then it is
 * worse than nothing. This one is quiet where it cannot read and loud where it
 * can, which covers the plain `Move` / `Add` / `Remove` that drift is made of.

 * first and immediately ate `{copied || 'Share as file'}`, an ordinary
