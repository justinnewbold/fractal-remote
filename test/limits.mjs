/**
 * What the Mac app is made of, and what it is allowed to claim.
 *
 * Packaging is the part of this project with no way to check itself at
 * runtime. A missing entitlement, a certificate that is present but empty, a
 * file the bundle references and does not ship, a device server pinned to a
 * commit that moved — every one of them builds cleanly and fails on somebody
 * else's machine, usually as "it won't open" with nothing to read.
 *
 * So these read the build config rather than the app: electron-builder.yml,
 * the entitlements, the workflow that signs it, and the lock file that says
 * which ForgeFX is inside.
 *
 * THIS FILE USED TO OPEN ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT — the two clocks around a
 * generation, the serverless function's ceiling in vercel.json against the
 * browser's own cap in lib/stream.js, which disagreed badly enough that a
 * function killed at 60 seconds looked like the model going quiet. Both files
 * went with the AI, and so did the tests that held them together.
