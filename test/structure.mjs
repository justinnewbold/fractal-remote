/**
 * Structural checks on App.jsx.
 *
 * Three bugs this session were about where things were rather than what they
 * did, and all sixty logic tests passed through every one: panels rendering in
 * Edit while every announcement said Library, the error banner living inside
 * Design so failures anywhere else were silent, and four props dropped while
 * rewriting a view.
 *
 * These read the source rather than mount it. That is a deliberate trade —
 * App.jsx cannot be imported by node, because the mock device imports JSON —
 * and it is enough, because the failures were all visible in the structure. A
 * panel in the wrong block, a missing prop and a banner nested inside a
 * conditional are all things you can see without a browser.
