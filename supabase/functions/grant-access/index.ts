/**
 * GIVE SOMEBODY THE UNLOCK BY HAND, OR TAKE A HAND-GIVEN ONE BACK.
 *
 * "If for some reason there's something weird where somebody makes a purchase
 * but it's not registering, do I have an ability to manually activate an
 * account for somebody?" and "Yes, build that in and only when logged into
 * the [his iCloud address] account."
 *
 * One request, four actions, the first three by the customer's email:
 *
 *   check   does this email have an account, and does it have the unlock
 *   grant   give it the unlock for good (a RevenueCat granted entitlement)
 *   revoke  take back an unlock given here — a purchase is not touched
 *   sales   every sale so far, for Sales at a glance
 *   usage   how many people used it lately, for How many people
 *
 * All three by email also answer with the Customer lookup: when they signed
 * up, whether they confirmed, what they paid for and where, which devices
 * they have signed in on, and the app version they were last on. "Do number
 * one and five for now."
 *
 * WHO MAY CALL IT is the whole of the safety, and it is decided here, on the
 * server, from a token Supabase has signed: the caller's own email has to be
 * the one below. The app hides the page from everybody else, but the page is
 * a convenience; this check is the lock.
 *
 * WHY REVENUECAT AND NOT JUST THE TABLE. Every end asks RevenueCat whether an
 * account has paid — the phone's store library, the browser's Web Billing and
 * the entitlement function behind the relay — so an unlock only counts
 * everywhere if RevenueCat says so. A granted entitlement is RevenueCat's own
 * way of saying "this account has it, without a purchase". The relay's table
 * is written as well, so the computer link works the same second rather than
 * the next time the customer opens the app.
