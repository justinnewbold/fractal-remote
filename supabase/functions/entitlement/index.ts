/**
 * Has this account paid?
 *
 * "Can we add the ability to purchase the license to unlock in the mac app and
 * web version now also?"
 *
 * The phone can answer that question by itself: RevenueCat's SDK is compiled
 * into it, and the store it talks to is the one that took the money. The
 * browser has neither. There is no App Store on a Mac running a downloaded
 * app and no Play Store in Chrome, so the computer has to ASK — and the only
 * key that can ask is a secret one, which cannot be put in a page anybody can
 * read the source of.
 *
 * So the question is asked here, on a server, and the answer comes back as a
 * single boolean.
 *
 * WHO IS ASKING IS NOT UP TO THE CALLER. The account id comes out of the
 * Supabase token the caller presents, verified against Supabase, never out of
 * the request body. A browser that could name its own account id would be a
 * browser that could unlock itself by typing somebody else's, and the whole
 * point of a server-side check is that it is not the client's word.
 *
 * WHY THE ACCOUNT ID IS THE RIGHT KEY. The phone calls RevenueCat's logIn with
 * exactly this id the moment somebody signs in — see mobile/src/lib/purchases
 * — so a purchase made on a handset lands on a RevenueCat customer named after
 * the Supabase account. Asking RevenueCat about that same id from here is
 * asking about the same person. It is the reason a purchase follows somebody
 * between a phone and a laptop at all.
 *
 * WHAT HAS TO BE SET, in Supabase -> Edge Functions -> Secrets:
 *
 *   REVENUECAT_SECRET   a V2 secret key from RevenueCat -> Project settings ->
 *                       API keys. V1 keys are a different API and will 401.
 *   REVENUECAT_PROJECT  the project id, proj... . Optional: it defaults to the
 *                       one below, which is this app's.
 *
 * With no key set this answers `unknown` rather than `no`, for the reason
 * given on the failure path further down.
