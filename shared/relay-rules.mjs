 * browser was the only thing at the far end of the channel. It isn't any more:
 * the phone apps in `mobile/` speak the same protocol to the same host, and a
 * second copy of an allowlist is a second copy that drifts. That has already
 * happened once inside this repo — eight routes disagreed with ForgeFX by the
 * time anyone compared them — and the two failure modes are both bad. Allowing
 * something the host refuses turns a friendly sentence into a bare status code
 * mid-song; refusing something the host allows leaves a dead panel with no
 * explanation at all.
 *
 * So one file, imported by both ends, in the shape `desktop/lib/project.mjs`
 * already proved works: zero imports, plain ESM, readable by Node in the
 * launchers, by Vite for the web bundle, and by Metro for the phone.

 * phone on a dark stage should not be able to overwrite slot 67 or move
 * firmware around. Naming the rule here lets both apps say so plainly instead
