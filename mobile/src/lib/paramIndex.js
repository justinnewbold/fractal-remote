/**
 * Every control in the preset, one flat list, so you can find one by name.
 *
 * "Where does the presence live" has one good answer per preset, and typing
 * three letters beats opening four blocks in turn to look — which is worse on a
 * phone than at a desk, because opening a block is a round trip to the Mac.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CACHE AND NOT A FUNCTION, which is the whole difference from
 * the browser's copy. Building the list means asking the unit for every block's
 * parameters, one block at a time, and `relay-rules` counts that read among the
 * slow ones: on an AM4 each one makes the unit dump its preset over serial. The
 * browser fires them down a local socket and nobody notices. Down a relay to a
 * Mac in the wings, a seven-block preset is seven of those — so it is built
 * once, kept, and reported on while it runs rather than freezing a search box
 * for ten seconds with no explanation.
 *
 * ONE AT A TIME, deliberately, like every other walk in this app. The relay is
 * a single channel to one Mac holding one serial port, and seven reads fired
 * together do not arrive sooner — they make the queue longer and the tuner, the
 * scene change and the knob you are turning wait behind them.
 *
 * LEVELS ARE NOT IN IT. The same rule the knob deck holds and for the same
 * reason: a level found in a search box and dragged by a finger is the silent
 * preset by another route.
