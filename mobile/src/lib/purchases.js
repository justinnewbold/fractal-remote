/**
 * The one purchase: paying to point this app at a real rig.
 *
 * "The app is gonna be a free download and then they can access the demo for
 * free and then we need to do an in app purchase to unlock it and we'll do the
 * app purchase at 9.99 that will unlock the full version."
 *
 * So the line is drawn exactly where the app stops being a toy: the DEMO is
 * free and complete, for ever, and driving the unit at your computer is what
 * costs. Nothing is time-limited and nothing expires — it is one payment for
 * one thing, which is what a non-consumable is.
 *
 * RevenueCat holds the receipts. Apple and Google each hand back their own
 * shape of proof-of-purchase, both of which have to be checked against the
 * right server and then remembered; RevenueCat does that and answers one
 * question instead — does this person have the entitlement. It also carries
 * the restore, which is not optional: Apple rejects an app that cannot give a
 * purchase back on a new handset.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY EVER LOCK SOMEBODY OUT BY ACCIDENT, and that is the rule
 * this file is built around rather than an afterthought. Three things can go
 * wrong and all three fail OPEN:
 *
 *   - the native module is missing — a build made before this existed, or a
 *     bundle running without it
 *   - no API key has been configured yet
 *   - the check itself fails: no signal, RevenueCat unreachable, a timeout
 *
 * In every one of those the answer is "not locked". The alternative is an app
 * that bricks itself in a room with bad wifi, and the people most likely to be
 * in that room are the ones on a stage about to play — which is the entire
 * audience for this app. A paywall that cannot take money must never be a
 * paywall that blocks the app.
 *
 * And the last-known answer is kept on disk, so somebody who HAS paid stays
 * unlocked through a flight, a basement, a dead hotspot and a reinstall-shaped
 * afternoon without RevenueCat being reachable at all.

 *
 * Every unlock route was gated on `available`, on the reasoning that a button
 * which cannot take money is worse than no button. The consequence is worse
 * than either: `available` is false whenever the store is not set up yet, or
 * unreachable, or still propagating permissions — and in all of those the
 * offer VANISHED COMPLETELY. An absent button is indistinguishable from a
 * feature that does not exist.
 *
 *   "I'm building this app and I don't know where to unlock it."
 *
 * That is the proof. He wrote it, he knew it was there, and he could not find
 * it, because on his handset the store was not ready and so the app had
 * silently erased every trace of the thing it is selling.
 *
 * So: the offer shows whenever somebody is in the demo and has not paid. What
 * `available` decides now is what the PAYWALL says when they get there —
 * a price and a working button, or an honest line about why not. A route to
 * an explanation beats no route at all, every time.
