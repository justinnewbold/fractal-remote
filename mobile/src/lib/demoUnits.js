 * Which Fractal the demo is pretending to be.
 *
 * "Demo for all Fractal units with real default presets and scenes."
 *
 * The demo was an FM3 and only ever an FM3, which is the wrong shape of
 * answer for somebody deciding whether this app is worth buying. An AM4 owner
 * opening it saw eight scene tiles their unit has not got, five hundred slots
 * it has not got, and a preset list sharing no names with theirs. The whole
 * point of a demo is that it can be checked against the thing on the desk.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS THE SIMULATION'S OWN SHAPE. Worth saying
 * plainly, because the rule this project runs on is that a wrong fact about
 * gear is worse than a missing one.
 *
 *   REAL, from data/factory-presets.csv and the source behind it: how many
 *   scenes a preset has, how many slots the unit holds, how many of those
 *   ship full, the channel letters, and every preset and scene name.
 *
 *   THE DEMO'S OWN: the block layout. A real unit reports its grid and this
 *   app reads it; nothing here has measured an FM9 or an Axe-Fx III, so
 *   rather than print a grid size nobody checked, the three grid units share
 *   the layout the demo's own twelve-block chain occupies. It is a simulation
 *   and says so on every screen. The AM4 and the VP4 report no grid at all,
 *   which is what an AM4 really does — see lib/gearCatalog on why "grid ×"
 *   is not a fact about one.
 *
 * There is deliberately no model id. Nothing outside the mock reads one, so
 * five invented numbers would be five things to be wrong about for no gain.
