 * How to get a computer on the other end of this, and what each route costs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR is the person holding a phone that says NO COMPUTER, who
 * has no idea a computer was ever part of the arrangement. Nothing in the app
 * said so: the sign-in screen asked for a code "your computer shows" and there
 * was no way from there to find out which computer, or how to make one show
 * anything.
 *
 * THREE ROUTES, ONE PER COMPUTER, AND ALL THREE ARE A DOWNLOAD. The page was
 * written when only the Mac app was real, and each route carries a `status`
 * for exactly that reason — so nobody is sent looking for a download that was
 * never built. What is left is the honest difference between them: the Mac app
 * is signed by Apple and opens without argument, the Windows app is not signed
 * yet and Windows says so in a blue box, and Linux gets an AppImage that runs
 * anywhere plus a .deb for the box in the rack.
 *
 * THE TWO TERMINAL ROUTES ARE GONE, and the reason is worth keeping because it
 * is the reason not to write them again.
 *
 * They pasted one line into a shell and built the device server from source,
 * which reads like the expert's shortcut. It never was one. The line fetched
 * three private repositories, so it stopped at the first `git fetch` for
 * everybody on earth except the person holding the token — and the steps had
 * to say "ask Justin for one" out loud, which is not a route, it is a
 * correspondence. The apps carry that same server inside them, signed and
 * vendored at build time, and they now cover all three computers. A route
 * whose first instruction is to email the author is worse than no route:
 * it costs a reader their time before it tells them it cannot help.
 *
 * So there is no tokenless version of this idea to go back and build. The
 * download IS the tokenless version.

 * WHERE THIS CODE ACTUALLY LIVES, in one place, because three things point at
 * it and none of them can be wrong.
 *
 * The download link the apps offer, the Mac app's own menu, and
 * electron-builder's publish block — which is BOTH where a release uploads
 * and where an installed Mac app looks for the next version.
 *
 * THE RENAME HAPPENED. "github and vercel rename are completed" — so this
 * says fractal-remote, which is what the prose here has said all along.
 *
 * It was pinned to the old name for a reason worth keeping written down: a
 * name that has never existed does not redirect, it 404s. Changing it early
 * published a desktop build at a repository that was not there and shipped a
 * Download link that went nowhere. The check before this moved was the old
 * name answering "Moved Permanently" from GitHub's API, which only happens
 * once a rename is real.
 *
 * GitHub redirects the OLD name from here on, so every link already in the
 * world — an installed Mac app looking for its next version, a Download
 * button on a page somebody bookmarked — keeps working.
