/**
 * Keeping the phone joined to the Mac, without anyone having to think about it.
 *
 * A phone is not a browser tab. It gets locked, put in a pocket, carried out of
 * range, handed from wifi to cellular and back, and backgrounded for the length
 * of a song. Every one of those closes the socket, and none of them mean the
 * player wanted to disconnect.
 *
 * So the link is a loop rather than a button: join, prove the Mac answers, and
 * keep proving it. Backs off while nothing answers so a phone in a bag is not
 * hammering a sleeping Mac, and never goes quiet for good — a Mac waking up is
 * found within half a minute of it doing so.
 *
 * The same three constants as the web app's link.js, because they were chosen
 * against the same failure: a green lamp that is lying is worse than a red one.
