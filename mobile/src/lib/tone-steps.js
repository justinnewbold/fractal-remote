/**
 * The order a tone is written to a unit, as data rather than as a loop.
 *
 * Two apps now write tones — the browser through `src/lib/forgefx.js`, and the
 * phone through `mobile/src/lib/tone.js` — and the order is not a detail. Get
 * it wrong and nothing errors: the unit accepts every write and ends up holding
 * a preset nobody asked for, which is the worst shape a bug can take here
 * because the only report is somebody playing it and frowning.
 *
 * Four rules, and each one is a thing that has to be true before the next
 * write means anything:
 *
 *   1. CHANNEL FIRST. A block's parameters belong to the channel it is on. Set
 *      gain on channel A and then move the block to B and you have dialled a
 *      channel nobody is going to hear.
 *
 *   2. THEN THE MODEL. Swapping a model replaces the whole parameter set —
 *      values written before it are values written to a block that no longer
 *      exists in that form.
 *
 *   3. RE-READ IF EITHER MOVED. Ranges belong to the model on the channel. A
 *      Plexi's gain and a Recto's gain are the same word over a different span,
 *      so a value computed against the old range lands somewhere else entirely.
 *
 *   4. PARAMETERS, THEN BYPASS. Bypass last so a block is never briefly
 *      audible holding half its new values — that is a noise through the amp
 *      at exactly the moment somebody is listening to hear whether the tone
 *      worked.
 *
 * And scenes go after all of it, never with it: a scene records WHICH BLOCKS
 * ARE ON, not what they sound like. Write them the other way round and every
 * scene is a pattern over a preset that has not been dialled yet.
 *
 * Pure on purpose. No device calls, no imports, no environment — it turns a
 * validated plan into a list of steps and each app carries them out with its
 * own client. That is what makes the order testable in Node against no
 * hardware, and what stops the two apps drifting apart on the one thing they
 * cannot afford to disagree about.
 */

/**
 * Every write a set of changes implies, in the order they must happen.
 *
 * Each step is `{ kind, eid, name, label }` plus what that kind needs. `label`
 * is what a progress line says while it runs — written here so both apps
 * describe the same work in the same words.
