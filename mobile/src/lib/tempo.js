/**
 * WHY TAPPING USED TO ANSWER WITH A TEMPO NOBODY PLAYED.
 *
 * "Right now after I tap it a few times slowly, it'll send a number and then
 * I'm done tapping and it sends back a different one … I understand it's
 * going over wifi and stuff, so but there's gotta be way to do it and make it
 * work."
 *
 * There is, and the wifi is the whole of it. Every press used to be forwarded
 * to the unit as a TAP — POST /tempo/tap, one per press — and the unit worked
 * the tempo out from the spacing between the taps AS THEY ARRIVED THERE.
 *
 * That spacing is not the spacing of a thumb. A tap leaving a phone crosses a
 * wifi network, a relay server somewhere on the internet, and a computer's own
 * queue before the unit sees it, and each of those adds a delay that is
 * different every time. Tap four times exactly one second apart and the unit
 * might receive them 1.00, 0.88, 1.15 and 0.97 seconds apart. It then reports,
 * correctly, the tempo of what it actually heard — which is not what was
 * played. The slower the taps, the longer the burst, the more room for the
 * jitter to add up.
 *
 * Nothing at the far end can fix that, because the information is destroyed
 * on the way. The only clock that knows what was tapped is the one in the
 * hand doing the tapping.
 *
 * SO THE TAPS NEVER LEAVE. The gaps are measured here, the tempo is worked
 * out here, and what goes to the unit is the NUMBER — the same call a typed
 * tempo uses. "Whatever it shows is what should get sent to the device", and
 * now it is, exactly. A read-back that follows can only confirm it: the unit
 * was told 132, so it says 132.
 */

/**
 * How long after the last tap to ask the unit what tempo it is on.
 *
 * Only a confirmation now. The unit has been told an exact number rather than
 * asked to work one out, so this can no longer come back with a surprise —
 * which is the point. What it still catches is a unit that refused the write
 * or rounded it, and that is worth one small read.
 *
 * It waits for the burst to end rather than following each press, because a
 * read mid-burst answers about the number sent one tap ago.

 *
 * Exactly right, and the delay was designed in. The number on the button only
 * ever came from the unit, and the unit can only be asked once tapping stops —
 * TAP_REREAD_MS above explains why — so the figure lagged the last tap by
 * nearly a second. Which defeats the point: you tap to FIND a tempo, and a
 * tempo you cannot see while tapping is one you cannot aim.
 *
 * And since 7.365.0 it is also what gets SENT — see the note above on why
 * forwarding the taps themselves could never work over a network.
