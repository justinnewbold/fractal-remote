 * Where a block sits, and how that becomes something the unit will accept.
 *
 * INDEXING IS THE TRAP, and it has already sprung once. `/preset/blocks`
 * reports a block's column counting from zero; the grid write routes take row
 * and column counting from one, to match FM-Edit. The old panel added one of
 * its own for a linear unit and then the wire added one on top, so slot 1 on an
 * AM4 was written to column 2 — and the cells it drew could never line up with
 * the blocks the unit reported, because those come back from zero.
 *
 * So the rule lives here, once, and everything above it deals in display
 * coordinates only: the ones `/preset/blocks` uses. The conversion happens at
 * the boundary, in `toWireCell`, and nowhere else.
 *
 * WHY BOTH APPS GET THIS FILE. A placement write changes a preset's STRUCTURE
 * rather than a value. A knob written to the wrong place sounds wrong and is
 * one drag from right; a block placed in the wrong cell is a preset somebody
 * has to rebuild. Two apps that counted columns differently would not disagree
 * out loud — one of them would simply put things one column along.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to a unit. It is all arithmetic about a grid, which is
 * what makes it testable without hardware.

/**
 * The cell as the write routes want it.
 *
 * BOTH COUNT FROM ZERO IN A READ AND FROM ONE ON THE WIRE. This used to shift
 * only the column, on the belief that rows already counted from one on both
 * sides. They do not: the FM3's preset dump numbers its rows 0-3, exactly as
 * it numbers its columns 0-11, and the write routes take rows 1-4 the way
 * FM3-Edit shows them. So a chain read on row 1 -- the second row, where the
 * factory presets keep theirs -- was written back to row 1 on the wire, which
 * is the TOP row. Every clear landed on an empty cell and did nothing; every
 * placement tried to put a block on the top row while the same block still
 * sat one row down, and the unit quietly declined. The unit answered "ok" to
 * all of it, and a log from an FM3 read "unit has it at 5" after every move,
 * with not one step refused.
 *
 * Rows are shifted here for the same reason columns are: once, at the
 * boundary, so a wrong row cannot happen one screen at a time.
