/**
 * Two copies of a stage — setlists, stars, and what Previous and Next walk —
 * made into one.
 *
 * SPLIT OUT OF cloudSetlists SO THE PHONE CAN HAVE IT. This is the part that
 * can lose somebody's work: a running order built at the Mac on Tuesday and a
 * star tapped on the phone on Wednesday have to both survive meeting each
 * other. Two apps merging by their own rules would not argue — they would
 * take turns overwriting, and the setlist that disappeared would look like a
 * setlist nobody saved.
 *
 * So it is here, once, and `npm run sync:rules` hands the phone the same copy.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE is the network. Reading and writing the account's row is
 * Supabase, and the two apps reach Supabase through different modules — so
 * each keeps its own twenty lines of transport and hands them to `syncStage`
 * below. Nothing in this file imports anything that is not already shared.
 *
 * ## What travels, and what does not
 *
 * The setlists, the stars, and which of them Previous and Next are stepping
 * through. NOT the recent list: which presets this phone played tonight is
 * about this phone, and two devices overwriting each other's history all
 * evening would be noise with no reader.
 *
 * Everything is kept per unit, exactly as it is locally — slot 4 on an FM3 and
 * slot 4 on an AM4 are different sounds, and a setlist of one must never play
 * as the other. The key is derived by shared/device-slug, on both ends, for
 * the same reason.
 *
 * ## Which copy wins
 *
 * Not "the newest device", which would throw away a setlist built on the other
 * one an hour earlier. Per THING:
 *
 *   a setlist   the later edit of that list, by id
 *   a delete    beats any copy of that list older than the delete
 *   the stars   the later tap, whole — a set of stars is a toggle, not a
 *               document, so half of each is not a thing anybody meant
 *   the source  the later choice
 *
 * Which needs times on things, and those are stamped by the two local modules
 * as they write. Anything from before that existed carries no time and reads
 * as the beginning — so a first sync unions rather than deletes, which is the
 * safe direction to be wrong in.
