 * Write one knob and do not wait to be told it landed.
 *
 * `setParamConfirmed` below is the right call for a knob somebody let go of:
 * it reads the value back, because this hardware accepts a write it then
 * ignores and reports success either way.
 *
 * It is the WRONG call for a slider being dragged. Confirming costs a second
 * round trip per value, and the volume slider sends one per frame — so the
 * read-backs alone would put the unit minutes behind a thumb. The volume
 * control uses this instead and coalesces on the way in (see lib/volume's
 * `latestWriter`, shared with the Mac): one write on the wire, newest value
 * wins, and the last one is confirmed when the drag ends.

/**
 * Write one knob, on whichever of the two paths the unit actually honours.
 *
 * The device accepts a write it then ignores, and reports success either way,
 * so confirming is the only way to know it landed. Tolerance is proportional
 * because the unit rounds — asking for 40 Hz can read back 39.998.
 *
 * Which path to try first is not a guess: encoding.js records that starting on
 * the discrete path slams every AM4 knob to its minimum before the retry
 * corrects it, which is audible. That file is generated from the browser's copy
 * so the two apps cannot drift on it.
 *
 * THE READ-BACK CAN BE ONE WRITE BEHIND, and a check that reads once and
 * believes it calls a write that landed a write that did not. The browser has
 * a log from an iPhone with five knobs in a row "not taking", each one reading
 * back the value of the write BEFORE it; and "The volume didn't take" on a
 * slider whose level was exactly where it had been put. So the check does what
 * the browser does — asks the computer to forget what it last read, which the
 * relay allows since the pinned fork — and then, if the number still does not
 * agree, waits a moment and reads once more before saying so. A miss costs
 * two reads and half a second. A false "didn't take" costs trust in the one
 * screen that has to be believed.
