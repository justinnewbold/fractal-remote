 * "What kind of information do we have to let people know they need to close
 * any of the fractal software, like FM3 edit… maybe we should add it in more
 * places." And: "is there a way to name the device specifically by detecting
 * which device they're using? If not, what do you think the best way is to
 * describe the devices?"
 *
 * Only one program can have a unit's USB connection, and Fractal's own editor
 * for that unit is the usual one that already has it. Its updater, Fractal-Bot,
 * is the other. So wherever this app knows which unit it is — connected now,
 * or the one last seen — the advice names that unit's editor, and where it
 * does not, it names them all rather than "another editor", which somebody
 * who only knows it as "AM4-Edit" might not recognise as theirs.
 *
 * One file, because the sentence appears on the computer's setup, the phone's
 * connection page, the troubleshooting list and the connect-a-computer steps,
 * and four hand-typed copies drift.

 * else (checked 10 October 2026): Fractal moved its downloads to one page per
 * unit (/fm3-downloads/, /am4-downloads/ and so on), and the Windows steps
 * this is linked from do not know which unit it is. The support page lists
 * every unit's downloads page, which is what the driver line already says to
 * look for. Check it still answers before changing it again.
