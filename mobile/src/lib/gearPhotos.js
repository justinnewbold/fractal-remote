/**
 * A photograph of the real amp, and the credit that has to travel with it.
 *
 * "All the amp/cabs/drive photos have been uploaded to GitHub so you can get
 * those wired up."
 *
 * WHY THE CREDIT IS NOT OPTIONAL AND NOT SEPARABLE. Every photograph here is
 * Creative Commons, and both CC BY and CC BY-SA require the photographer be
 * named wherever the picture is shown. So `photoFor` never answers with a
 * picture alone — the holder, the licence and the link to it come back in the
 * same object, and a caller that draws the image has the credit already in its
 * hand. There is no shape of this function that returns a URL by itself,
 * deliberately: that is the shape somebody renders without the attribution.
 *
 * MATCHED BY FAMILY, THE SAME WAY LINEAGE IS. One photograph of a Super Lead
 * serves "1959SLP Normal", "1959SLP Treble" and "1959SLP Jumped", because they
 * are one amplifier described three ways. The rule is a prefix on the slug and
 * it is deliberately strict about the boundary: `texas-star` matches
 * `texas-star-clean` and `texas-star-lead`, and does not match `texas-starlet`
 * if somebody ever adds one. Matching loosely here would put a photograph of
 * the wrong amp under a model name, which is the exact failure that threw away
 * the first batch of two hundred.
 *
 * A model with no picture answers null, and the screen shows nothing rather
 * than a placeholder. Since 1.86.50 every model in the catalog has one — a
 * photograph where an openly licensed one exists, a drawing (marked as one)
 * where it does not — so null now means a name the catalog does not carry.

/**
 * Where the files are served from.
 *
 * `public/` is copied to the site root, so a page served by the app — the
 * hosted site, or the computer with the cable — finds them one level down
 * from wherever it is. A relative path is right for both of those and wrong
 * for exactly one caller: the PHONE app, which is not a web page and has no
 * site root to be relative to.
 *
 * Bundling the files into the phone was the other option and is the wrong
 * one: 55 photographs is already 7MB and a full roster would be four times
 * that, downloaded again by every phone on every over-the-air update, to show
 * pictures somebody looks at twice. So the phone passes the hosted origin and
 * the images come over the network. With no internet it shows the words and
 * no picture, which is what it does for three quarters of the roster anyway.
