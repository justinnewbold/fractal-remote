/**
 * What every slot on the unit is called, learned a few at a time.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A PIECE OF THE PICKER. Two screens need these
 * names now — the preset list, and the setlist sheet that shows tonight's
 * running order by name rather than by number — and asking the unit what slot
 * 412 is called is not cheap. `relay-rules` counts `/presets/{n}` among the
 * slow reads because the unit reads that preset off its own hardware to answer.
 * Two screens with their own caches would ask for the same name twice, down the
 * one serial port everything else is queued behind.
 *
 * ONE READ AT A TIME, for the same reason. Firing twenty at the relay does not
 * make the unit answer faster; it makes the queue longer and the tuner, the
 * scene change and the preset load wait behind them.
 *
 * AND ONLY WHILE SOMEBODY IS LOOKING. `useNames` counts the screens mounted,
 * and the queue drains only while that count is above zero. Without it, closing
 * the picker after a scroll would leave the unit reading presets for the next
 * half-minute while somebody is playing — work nobody can see the result of.
 * What has already been read is kept: names do not go stale, and coming back to
 * the list should not mean reading them again.
 *
 * AND MOST OF THEM ARE NEVER READ FROM HERE AT ALL. "When selecting presets for
 * the first time, it scrolls through and has to load them all as you're
 * scrolling. Is there a way we can set this to load in the background when the
 * app is first opened so that they're all there?" There is, and it is not to
 * have the phone read five hundred presets over the relay in the background —
 * that is the same port everything else waits behind, and the browser at the
 * computer has been reading them quietly for weeks. It has the cable; it leaves
 * the port alone between slots; and it writes what it learns into the
 * computer's own store. So the phone takes THAT, in one request that never
 * touches the unit, the moment it connects — and keeps it on disk, so the list
 * is full from the first frame of the next launch, before the computer has
 * even answered. Whatever the computer has not learned yet still fills in on
 * screen the way it always has, and is kept too.
