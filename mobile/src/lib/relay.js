/**
 * The phone end of the link to the Mac.
 *
 * ForgeFX on the Mac acts as a host agent: signed in to Supabase, it subscribes
 * to the private channel `remote:<uid>` and executes allowlisted requests
 * against its own local server, replying on the same channel. This is the other
 * end of that — the phone in your hand at the far side of a stage.
 *
 * The channel is private and RLS-scoped to one user, so both ends must be
 * signed in as the same person. That is the whole of the security model, and it
 * is a good one: nobody else can join, by construction rather than by
 * convention.
 *
 * This is a port of src/lib/remote.js, not a redesign. Every behaviour here was
 * paid for on a stage — the grace period around a dropped socket, the roll call
 * that counts how many Macs are listening, the refusal to write while more than
 * one is. Three things differ, and only because the platform differs: the
 * session is kept in AsyncStorage rather than localStorage, payloads are
 * decoded without browser APIs (see decode.js), and the rules that must match
 * the host word for word are a generated copy (see relay-rules.js).
