/**
 * The demo, answered at the same door every real request goes through.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, NOT TWENTY-EIGHT. `device.js` has twenty-eight functions and every
 * one of them ends at `remoteRequest`, `post` or `put` — so this is the only
 * seam where the simulated unit can stand in without every call site learning
 * about it. Put the check in each function instead and the demo becomes a
 * second implementation of the app, which is how a demo starts telling you
 * things that are not true about the real thing.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS: the path-to-method mapping the host does on a real computer,
 * done here against `mockDevice`. The routes are the host's own, so if this and
 * ForgeFX ever disagree about what `/preset/blocks` means, the demo is the one
 * that is wrong and it shows up as a screen that works on a rig and not here.
 *
 * NO ARTIFICIAL DELAY, deliberately, and it is the whole point of the thing:
 *
 *   "It helps me make sure the lag isn't just the app, also."
 *
 * A demo that pretended to be as slow as a serial port would be prettier and
 * would answer nothing. This answers instantly, so a screen that is STILL slow
 * in the demo is slow because of this app — and one that is quick here and slow
 * on a rig is waiting on the wire. Nothing else in this project can tell those
 * two apart.
 */

/*
 * HANDED THE UNIT RATHER THAN FETCHING IT, so this file can be run.
 *
 * Reaching for the demo switch here would drag React and the phone's storage
 * in with it, and neither of those exists in the test runner — which would
 * leave the one piece of this worth exercising as the one piece nobody could.
 * The mapping is the whole risk: miss a route and the failure is not an error,
 * it is an empty screen in a mode built for looking around.
