/**
 * Setlists and stars, already told where the bytes live.
 *
 * The shared modules take their storage as a last argument so the browser can
 * hand them localStorage and the phone can hand them something else. That is
 * the right shape for the modules and the wrong one for a screen: every call
 * site would end in `, sync`, and the one that forgot would not fail — it would
 * quietly read the browser's storage, which on a phone is nothing at all. An
 * empty setlist and a setlist nobody looked up are the same picture.
 *
 * So the binding happens once, here, and screens import from this file.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT WRAPPED is anything pure. `orderFor`, `stepTarget`, `positionIn`,
 * `sourceLabel`, `addTo`, `removeFrom` and `moveIn` are handed what they need
 * and touch no storage, so they pass straight through and are re-exported as
 * they are.
