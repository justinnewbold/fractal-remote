 * How much of the stage screen one button gets.
 *
 * The Play screen has always been one size, chosen once, for a phone held at
 * arm's length in the dark. That is the right default and the wrong rule: a
 * preset with eight scenes and nine blocks does not fit at that size, and a
 * preset with two scenes wastes most of the screen at it. Which of those you
 * have is not something the app can know, and it changes with the preset.
 *
 * So it is a setting, and the setting is two buttons. Bigger trades how much
 * you can see for how easily you can hit it; smaller trades back. Nobody has
 * to be told which they want — they press one and look.
 *
 * The steps are concrete pixel pairs rather than a multiplier on a base,
 * because the two numbers do not scale together: the column floor decides how
 * many fit across a row, and it has to clear a scene NAME at the size the tile
 * is drawn, not a proportion of it.
 */

/**
 * `tile` is the button's min-height; `col` the grid's column floor, which is
 * what actually decides how many land on a row.
 *
 * STEP 1 IS THE DEFAULT, and it is now the layout he chose from a screenshot:
 * scenes two across in colour, effects four across in three letters. It was
 * "today's screen, exactly" before that, which is the right instinct for a
 * control that changes what you reach for mid-song — but the whole point of
 * this change is that the default look moved.
 *
 * `scenes` and `fx` are how many land on a ROW ON A PHONE, which is the thing
 * the layout he asked for is actually about: scenes two across in colour, the
 * effects four across underneath in three letters. A pixel floor could not say
 * that — it says "at least this wide" and lets the viewport decide the rest,
 * which is why the default came out three across and never two.
 *
 * Phone only. On a desktop the grids stay on the pixel floors and auto-fit,
 * because two scene buttons across 1200px is not a design, it is a mistake.
 *
 * A scene is WIDER than an effect at every step, including the smallest — "try
 * making them wider". Two grids of identical tiles read as one grid however
 * they are coloured, and size is the difference you notice before you have
 * looked at anything.

 * the tap floor, but never past four — see FX_MAX. When no width gets the
 * tile over the floor, the floor wins: a preset that big scrolls, which is
 * what it did before.
 *
 * TWO LIMITS ON GOING WIDER, both from an FM3 on a small phone:
 *
 * "On smaller phones, it looks like the tiles are too small to see the
 * glyphs… it looks like having six across might be too many."
 *
 * Eight scenes and eight blocks went six across, and the six-across row was
 * no shorter than four across would have been: eight blocks are two rows at
 * four, five or six. So the tiles got narrower for nothing — the picture
 * landed on top of the On and the names became "C…" and "TR…". A wider row
 * is only worth taking when it saves a row, and when two widths save the
 * same, the narrower one wins.
 *
 * And a tile has to stay wide enough for what is drawn on it: the picture,
 * three letters, On/Off in one corner and the channel in the other. `width`
 * is the row it has to fit in; `minWidth` is the narrowest tile that still
 * holds all of that.
 *
 * AND NEVER MORE THAN FOUR ACROSS.
 *
 * "Make this so on the effects pedals, there's only a max of four across
 * that can go on the screen. Because it looks good on the iPhone. And looks
 * terrible on the Android phone." Side by side, the same FM3 preset: four
 * across on the iPhone, every name whole; six on the Android, every name
 * "C…", "A…", "P…". Five and six were the old answer to a long chain not
 * fitting, and they bought the rows back by making every tile unreadable. A
 * chain that does not fit at four scrolls instead.
