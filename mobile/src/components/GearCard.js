/**
 * One model, on a page of its own.
 *
 * "Still not seeing any amp cab and pedal photos or descriptions. Should be
 * able to tap on the card and open a detailed page like this."
 *
 * The photographs and the descriptions were written and wired into one place
 * only — the panel inside the block editor, for the model already chosen,
 * which is the one model nobody is wondering about. The reference list, whose
 * whole purpose is "what have I got", was rows that could not be opened.
 *
 * Reading order, which is the order the questions come in: what the unit
 * calls it, what it really is, what it is like, what it looks like.
 *
 * WHERE THE PICTURE COMES FROM. Over the network, from the hosted site, and
 * not out of the app bundle. 55 photographs is 7MB and a finished roster
 * would be four times that — downloaded again by every phone on every
 * over-the-air update, for pictures somebody looks at twice. With no internet
 * this shows the words and no picture, which is what it does for three
 * quarters of the roster in any case.
 *
 * THE CREDIT IS PART OF THE PICTURE. Every one of these is Creative Commons
 * and naming the photographer is a condition of showing it at all, so there
 * is no arrangement of this screen that draws one without the other.
 */
/*
 * ONE MODEL AT A TIME, AND THE NEXT ONE A SWIPE AWAY.
 *
 * "Make it so swiping left or right on the screen takes you forward or
 * backwards to the next amp model. Also have little arrow buttons on each
 * side of the screen… Have the All models button take them back." And
 * smoothly: the page follows the finger, then slides off as the next one
 * slides in, the way a phone's own photo viewer does. It is the core
 * Animated library, so it costs no build.
 *
 * `entries` is the list the page was opened from (the tab and the search as
 * they were), and it wraps round at both ends, so the arrows never go dead.
 *
 * The swipe is claimed here, deeper than the app's swipe-from-the-edge back
 * gesture, so a sideways swipe on this page always means "next model" and
 * never "leave". Android's own back gesture comes to All models too, rather
 * than out of the app.
