/**
 * The needle, over everything else.
 *
 * "Tuner displays under the tuner button and isn't visible without scrolling."
 * It was drawn in the flow of a screen that scrolls, at the bottom, under the
 * button that turns it on — so switching the tuner on did nothing you could
 * see. Tuning is not a thing you do alongside something else: for as long as it
 * is on, it is the only thing on the screen, and it is the size of the screen.
 *
 * A modal rather than a panel, because it has to cover the link bar and the
 * preset and everything else. Tapping anywhere closes it and stops the tuner at
 * the unit, which is the gesture somebody makes without looking.
 *
 * WHY THE READING CAN BE ABSENT, which is most of why this file is longer than
 * a needle needs to be. `POST /tuner` is allowed over the relay, so a phone can
 * start the unit's tuner and then never see a reading: the relay bridges
 * discrete change events and deliberately filters the roughly eight-per-second
 * telemetry streams to keep the channel quiet, and the tuner is one of them. The
 * poll runs at the Mac and every answer stays there.
 *
 * So after five silent seconds it says exactly that, rather than showing a
 * needle that will never move while somebody stands there playing an open E.
 * Tracked by time rather than by a flag, so a newer host that does bridge the
 * stream lights this up with no change here.
