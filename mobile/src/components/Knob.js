/**
 * A rotary control.
 *
 * Fractal's editors use knobs because the hardware does, and because a knob
 * shows where a value sits in its range at a glance in a way a number never
 * does.
 *
 * WHY A RING OF MARKS RATHER THAN A SWEPT ARC. The browser draws the sweep as
 * an SVG path. There is no SVG here and adding it would mean a native module in
 * the build — and the build is the one thing in this project that costs Justin
 * something that does not come back, so it is not a dependency to take on for a
 * curve. A ring of marks, lit up to the current value, says the same thing out
 * of plain views: where you are in the range, from arm's length, without
 * reading the number. It is also what the unit's own display does.
 *
 * DRAGGING IS VERTICAL ONLY, and that is not a simplification. Circular
 * tracking sounds right and isn't — the finger leaves the knob, and small
 * movements near the centre produce huge jumps. Every hardware editor uses a
 * vertical drag for the same reason.
 *
 * THE DRAG CLAIMS THE GESTURE ON TOUCH, not on the first movement. A knob lives
 * inside a screen that scrolls vertically, and a drag that waits to see which
 * way the finger is going has already given the gesture to the scroll view on a
 * phone. The browser's copy of this makes exactly the same trade, by calling
 * preventDefault in a non-passive touchstart. The cost is that a finger landing
 * on a knob cannot then scroll the page, which is the right way round: the
 * knobs are what the screen is for.
 *
 * `live` holds the current props for the responder, which is created once. Not
 * a micro-optimisation — a responder rebuilt mid-drag is a drag that stops.
