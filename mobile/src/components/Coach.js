/**
 * The channel tip, drawn where the gesture is.
 *
 * "This tip appears here - exactly when the gesture becomes useful."
 *
 * That line is a promise, so this is not a screen in the walkthrough and not
 * a dialog over the app. It is a card in the chain, directly above the tiles
 * it is talking about, shown only on a preset whose blocks really do have
 * channels to choose between. Somebody reading it can look down and try it
 * without dismissing anything first.
 *
 * WHICH IS ALSO WHY IT DOES NOT DIM THE SCREEN. A coach mark that greys out
 * the rig to point at it takes away the one thing the reader needs — the
 * blocks — for as long as it is up. This one costs a few lines of height and
 * hands the screen straight back.
 *
 * Not one word is typed here. Every string comes from the copy file, the
 * same as both walkthroughs: "do not change any wording without asking me
 * first", and copy that lives in a component is copy that gets tidied by
 * accident.
