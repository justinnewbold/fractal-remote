/**
 * The volume, on the stage screen.
 *
 * "Add volume slider to the play screen to quickly turn volume up or down."
 *
 * It moves the Output block's Level — the one control that is the whole
 * preset's volume, and the thing a soundperson means by "give me a bit less".
 * The edit screen shows it and will not turn it, deliberately: a level dragged
 * to the bottom by accident makes a preset that looks right and is silent. That
 * rule is about a knob among thirty others under a thumb. This is the opposite
 * — one control, the width of the screen, that is FOR moving the volume, with
 * the number on it the whole time.
 *
 * WHY THE DRAG DOES NOT SEND EVERY VALUE. A slider reports one per frame, and
 * the unit takes one request at a time down a serial port with a relay to a Mac
 * in front of it. Sent as they come, a two-second drag queues a hundred writes
 * that the unit works through for the next ten seconds — landing on the value
 * you let go of long after you let go, and holding up the scene you pressed
 * next. `latestWriter` is shared with the Mac and does the coalescing: one
 * write out, the newest value replacing whatever was queued behind it.
 *
 * AND THE LAST ONE IS CONFIRMED. Everything mid-drag goes out unconfirmed,
 * because a read-back per frame is the same jam by another name. The value the
 * thumb comes off on is written again the careful way, because that is the one
 * that has to be true.
 *
 * MINUS AND PLUS EITHER SIDE. "Do a plus minus on the sides of the volume
 * slider that does 1 dB at a time." A dB is the unit a soundperson talks in and
 * a whole one is the smallest change worth a press: the slider is for the
 * sweep, the buttons for landing on a number.
 */
/*
 * IT IS A POP-UP, and that is not decoration — it is the fix.
 *
 * "Volume slider also tries to scroll the screen when sliding the volume. Just
 * an overlay that pops up on the screen separately would be cool… whatever we
 * gotta do to fix that so that when you tap the volume button, the volume
 * slider pops up and is able to be slid without scrolling or moving anything
 * else."
 *
 * A slider drags across a screen that scrolls, and on iOS the scroll view's pan
 * gesture recogniser is NATIVE: it takes the touch back and terminates the drag
 * rather than losing to a JavaScript responder. There are fixes that fight
 * that — the bench's knobs use one — but for a control that is wanted twice a
 * night the better answer is to take the fight away entirely. In a modal there
 * is no scroll view behind it and nothing to argue with.
 *
 * The browser reached the same place from the other direction: "put a sound
 * button that looks like a speaker in the header, and when it's tapped you can
 * slide the volume left or right… but it's not there on the main screen."
 */
/**
 * Why there is nothing to write to, told apart rather than guessed at.
 *
 * This said "the chain is still loading" for both, and it was the wrong half
 * of the time: the chain HAD been read, and the Output block in it came back
 * with no id to address. Blaming a read that already happened sends somebody
 * to wait for something that has finished, which is the worst kind of wrong
 * message — it looks like patience is the answer.
 *
 * With the bar's speaker now asking the same question this does, neither
 * should be reachable at all. They are kept because they are what says so if
 * the two ever disagree again.
