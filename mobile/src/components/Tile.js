/**
 * A coloured tile, for the two things on this screen that have an identity.
 *
 * `Press` is the app's button and stays the app's button: one shape, one
 * meaning of colour, amber for the audio path. That grammar works for a row of
 * controls and breaks for a grid of eight scenes, because every tile in the
 * grid would then be the same colour and tell you nothing until you read it.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FOLLOWS, and it is the browser's, in sceneColors' own words:
 * colour is identity and brightness is state. A scene keeps its hue whether or
 * not it is live; a filled tile is the one you are in. The blocks say the same
 * thing one step further — a drive is red on the unit's own screen, so a screen
 * pretending to be that hardware had better agree, and the fill says engaged
 * while the edge keeps saying drive even when it is off.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this is worth a component rather than a style prop.
 * On a dark stage the eye finds the red long before three letters resolve, and
 * an app that only agreed with the unit some of the time would be worse than
 * one that never tried.
 *
 * The colours themselves are not decided here. `blockColors.js` and
 * `sceneColors.js` are generated from the browser's copies by
 * `npm run sync:rules`, so the two screens cannot drift into disagreeing about
 * which tile is the delay.

          in the middle of the tile where the eye already is, which is the
          whole argument for colouring these tiles at all.

          block already says On or Off in words.
