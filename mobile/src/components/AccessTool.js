 * GIVE SOMEONE ACCESS — Justin's page, and nobody else's.

 * "If for some reason there's something weird where somebody makes a purchase
 * but it's not registering, do I have an ability to manually activate an
 * account for somebody?" Type their email; Check says whether they have the
 * unlock; Give access gives it to them for good; Take it back removes one given
 * here. The server does the work and decides who may ask — see
 * supabase/functions/grant-access.
 *
 * And the Customer lookup under whichever answer comes back: when they signed
 * up, what they paid for and where, which devices they are signed in on, the
 * app version they were last on. "Do number one and five for now."
