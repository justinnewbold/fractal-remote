 * One line, above everything, in every state — the browser's bar, on a phone.
 *
 * "Make sure the iOS app shows this exact header." It was a different bar
 * saying a different thing: a sentence, "Connected to MacBook Pro SG 566",
 * which named the Mac and nothing else. The unit was not on it, the version was
 * two sheets away under Setup, and the speaker and the gear were down in the
 * slot row competing with Edit for a corner of the stage screen.
 *
 * Left to right, the same five things and in the same order as the browser: the
 * lamp, the unit's short name, the version, the state of the link in one word,
 * the volume, and setup. Every one of them is a fact somebody checks BEFORE
 * playing — what am I plugged into, what am I running, is it live — and none of
 * them belongs on a screen you have to go and find.
 *
 * WHAT IT NO LONGER SAYS is which Mac. That sentence was the whole of the old
 * bar and it is the one fact here nobody needs mid-song: there is normally one
 * Mac, and when there is more than one the setup screen is where you choose
 * between them. The name is still there, under the gear.
 *
 * The words come from shared/link-word.mjs rather than from here, so the two
 * apps cannot drift into saying different things about the same link.

        The gear is a picture now, and it is his own.

        It was the character ⚙, and that cost a bug: "The settings icon is too
        dark to even see, but if I click where it's supposed to be" — on
        Android. The character is drawn from the phone's text font in the text
        colour, which nobody had set, so it took the default: black, on a bar
        that is nearly black. Giving it a colour fixed the invisibility and
        left the real problem, which is that the two platforms were drawing
        two different gears: Apple swaps that character for its own picture,
        Android draws the outline from its font.

        The one in the file is cut out of Justin's mockup of the play screen,
        so both phones now show the gear he drew. Tinted rather than coloured
        in, for the same reason every other picture here is — see
        mobile/assets/icons. The speaker beside it is one too now, the browser's shape.
