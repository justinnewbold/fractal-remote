 * debug."
 *
 * THIS MATTERS MORE ON A PHONE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE and the phone had none. A
 * browser has a console somebody can open; a phone on a dark stage has nowhere
 * at all for a failure to go, so every bad evening was unreconstructable — the
 * screen showed the latest state and nothing about the sequence that produced
 * it. "It kept dropping" cannot be answered from a screen that says
 * "Connected".
 *
 * WHAT GOES IN IT is written at the two choke points every trip passes through:
 * lib/relay logs the shape of each request that failed or took a noticeable
 * moment, and lib/link logs every change of mind about the Mac. Bodies are
 * deliberately not kept — this is written to be pasted into a chat, and a
 * preset dump is neither readable nor anybody else's business.
 *
 * THE COPY CARRIES A HEADER, because the first three questions about any report
 * are which build, which unit and which end of the link — and none of them can
 * be read off the lines themselves.
