/**
 * The first minute, on the phone.
 *
 * Nine screens in the PDF, and the shape of them is a decision rather than a
 * sequence: this phone cannot reach a Fractal unit on its own, ever. It talks
 * to a computer, and the computer holds the cable. Everything here is either
 * explaining that or getting one of the two ends in place.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THE DEMO COMES FIRST AND COSTS NOTHING. Somebody who has just
 * installed this may have no computer running, no code, and no idea a
 * computer was part of the arrangement. Sending them to a pairing screen
 * would be sending them to a dead end. The demo is a whole app against a
 * simulated unit, so the answer to "can I look around" is yes, immediately.
 *
 * AND THE PURCHASE IS NOT OFFERED HERE AT ALL ANY MORE. It used to be, on a
 * screen that could say "Connection verified" because a pairing had just
 * succeeded one step earlier. Pairing left this screen with the codes: it is
 * a sign-in now, and signing in leaves the walkthrough. The Paywall asks the
 * question instead, which is where it was always asked for everybody who did
 * not arrive through here.
 *
 * Not one word is typed here: every string is from lib/onboarding, generated
 * from shared/onboarding.mjs. "Do not change any wording without asking me
 * first."

                The reasoning at the time was that this button takes no money
                and the store's own sheet quotes the price, so the walkthrough
                should go on explaining the arrangement and let the purchase
                happen later. That is defensible and it is not what the screen
                says: a button reading Unlock, under a lock, under "Unlock
                live control for your Fractal hardware", promises a purchase.

                What actually happened when Justin pressed it: "the unlock
                button and the two buttons at the bottom where it says sign in
                and the button where it says restore purchase, all take you to
                the other screen" — the sign-in form, three times over, from
                three buttons that say three different things.

                No price on the button itself. The store quotes it in its own
                sheet a moment later, and a price here would be this app's
                guess at one.

                His mockup puts a small lock in the button too. Press has no
                icon slot and widening a component used on every screen for
                one glyph is the wrong trade — the card's own lock, above

                It did. The address was a button, and tapping a button on a phone
                opens the thing on the phone — so it went to the downloads page on
                the handset and started fetching a Mac installer onto a device
                that can do nothing whatever with it.

                This phone is never the computer that needs this download. That is
                the whole difficulty of the step, and a button is a promise that
                pressing it does something useful. So the address is text to read
                and type somewhere else, with the eyebrow above it saying where,
                and the only thing to press is the one that sends the link to a
                machine that can use it.
