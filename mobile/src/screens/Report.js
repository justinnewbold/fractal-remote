 * Telling us something is broken, or asking for something — from the phone.
 *
 * THE PHONE HAD NOWHERE TO SAY SO, which is the gap this fills. The browser
 * has had a box like this for a while, and a handset — the surface where the
 * bad evenings actually happen — could copy its log and nothing else. The
 * report only ever arrived if somebody remembered to paste it into a message
 * later, from another device, after the gig.
 *
 * TWO KINDS AND ONLY ONE CARRIES THE LOG. Somebody asking for a bigger tuner
 * has not offered a transcript of their evening, and this screen does not
 * quietly take one: the switch is not drawn at all on that side. On the bug
 * side it is drawn, it is on, and it can be turned off — and what it would
 * send can be read in full first, by the same function that sends it, so the
 * preview cannot drift from the thing being previewed.
 *
 * Nothing is gathered while somebody types. The log is read when Send is
 * pressed and at no other moment, so a report half-written and abandoned
 * leaves no copy of anything anywhere.
