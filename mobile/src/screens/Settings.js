                  IS the app until it is bought.

                  Nobody is shut in. Heading for Sign in ends the demo too —
                  see App.js's toSignIn — and the sign-in screen offers the
                  demo again, so the way out for somebody who has not paid is

                it is not on the walkthrough they have been past, and signing
                in ends it — so this is the door he asked to keep. Here rather

                made: they are signed in, they own the app, and the demo is
                simply one of the things it has. A place, not a pitch.

                And no heading over it, which he confirmed. A heading here
                would be a sentence I wrote rather than one he did, and the

 *
 * Five buttons in a wrapping row said five things at once and took two lines
 * to do it. A stepper says the one thing that matters — what it is set to
 * now — and the two ways to change it sit either side of the answer.
 *
 * FIT IS A TICK BOX UNDER IT, NOT A SIXTH STEP, because it is not a size: it
 * is the screen deciding instead of you. While it is on the stepper reads
 * "Fit to screen" and its buttons go quiet, which is the honest way to show a
 * control whose value is being overridden — greying them says "not now"
 * where hiding them would say "never".
 *
 * On out of the box. It is the right answer for everybody who has not got an
 * opinion yet, which is everybody on the first launch.
