/**
 * How tall one row is, and the space under it.

 * a list of five hundred slots cannot be measured to find one. Everything in a
 * row is pinned to this: the button, the star, and the gap. A row that grew
 * taller than this without the number moving would send "jump to preset 99" to
 * somewhere near preset 99, which is worse than not jumping.
 *
 * The gap is a margin rather than the container's `gap` for the same reason —

/**
 * Every slot on the unit, by name, so you can get to one.
 *
 * Previous and Next are the right controls mid-song and the wrong ones between
 * songs. "Two more presses and I am on SCHISM" is a thing you can do; finding
 * SCHISM among five hundred slots by stepping is not, and that was the whole of
 * the phone's preset story until now.
 *
 * WHY THE NAMES ARRIVE SLOWLY, which is the thing worth understanding before
 * changing anything here. Asking the unit what slot 412 is called makes it read
 * that preset off its own hardware — `relay-rules` counts `/presets/{n}` among
 * the slow reads for exactly that reason. Five hundred of them on opening this
 * screen would lock up the unit for a minute while somebody waited to press one
 * button.
 *
 * So the list draws immediately with numbers, and names fill in for the rows
 * actually on screen, a few at a time. Scrolling asks for more. A row whose
 * name has not arrived yet is not blank — it says its number, which is what it
 * had before and is never wrong. The reading itself lives in lib/presetNames,
 * shared with the setlist sheet so the same slot is never read twice.
 *
 * THE STAR is the second thing this list does. Starred presets are one of the
 * three things Previous and Next can walk, and the star belongs where you are
 * looking at the preset — so it is the right-hand end of every row, on its own
 * target, away from the part of the row that loads the preset.
