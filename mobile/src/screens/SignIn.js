 * "I want the QR code gone and the scanner gone. It has never worked once…
 * to use this app and connect it to your computer, you have to sign up.
 * That's the way we're doing it."
 *
 * There used to be a second route: the computer made an eight-character code
 * standing for a hidden account, the phone scanned it off a QR code or typed
 * it, and nobody made an account at all. It was the first thing this screen
 * offered. It is gone — camera, code box and all — because across every
 * attempt it never once worked end to end, and two routes meant two sets of
 * instructions, two failure modes and a different answer every time.
 *
 * What is left is the account. The demo is still free and still needs none;
 * the computer app is still free and still needs none. Joining a phone to a
 * computer is the one thing that does, and both ends sign into the same one.
 *
 * Nothing here mentions a channel, a relay, or the name of the account
 * service — that part has not changed.

   * It used to wait for the unlock: "On the phones, only show the create
   * account window after the phone has been unlocked", on the reasoning that
   * an account only joins a phone to a computer, which is the paid half. Then
   * Give access arrived, and an account became the way a tester is let in:
   * "I tried to set my daughter up with a free account on iPhone, but in the
   * app it doesn't let you set up an account until you've purchased... I
   * still wanna recruit some testers sometimes and give them access, and I
   * don't wanna make it difficult for them."
   *
   * So Create account opens the form for everybody. Nothing is given away by
   * it: an account that has not been unlocked signs in to the purchase page
   * (App.js, shouldAskToPay), and one Justin has given access to, or put on
   * the waiting list, is unlocked the moment it signs in (the entitlement
   * function claims the waiting list). Buying without an account is still
   * the demo's Unlock.
