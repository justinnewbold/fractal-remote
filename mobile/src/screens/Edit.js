/**
 * Add, remove and move blocks.
 *
 * THE GRID IS NOT DRAWN AS A GRID, deliberately. Forty-eight cells of which
 * five hold anything is three cells visible on a phone and a scroll to find the
 * one you want — the browser had exactly that and the report was blunt: "the
 * rest you can't really add anything or change anything… let's rethink that
 * whole thing." So each row of the grid is a LANE: what is actually in it, in
 * signal order, with the free cells between it shown as gaps you can tap.
 * Nothing is hidden — the column number is on every card and a preset with
 * parallel rows gets a lane each — but nothing is drawn that isn't there.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ABOUT WRITING HERE ARE WORTH KNOWING BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF IT.
 *
 * Placement writes STRUCTURE rather than a value, so a bad write mangles a
 * preset rather than mis-setting a knob. Which is why the column arithmetic is
 * `lib/grid-plan`, shared with the Mac rather than done again here: getting it
 * wrong once already put slot 1 of an AM4 into column 2.
 *
 * And this hardware answers `ok:false` to writes that landed. The browser's old
 * editor took that at its word and rolled back moves that had worked — "delete
 * works, the rest doesn't". So nothing here acts on it: the answer is shown,
 * the chain is re-read from the unit, and you look.
 *
 * Folded away until asked for. It is the least-reached-for thing on the bench
 * and the easiest to press by accident.

        A SPLIT CHAIN, SAID OUT LOUD.

        The app knows where every block sits. It does not know how the rows are
        JOINED — there is no read for the cables anywhere, only a write — so on
        a preset that runs down two rows it can describe half of what is there
        and has no way to tell a deliberate split from two unrelated rows.

        Drawing that silently is the problem. Two lanes with no comment reads
        either as one chain that happens to wrap, or as an editor that
        understands the routing and is showing it to you. Neither is true, and
        the second is the one that gets a preset rebuilt. Moving blocks WITHIN a
        row is safe and stays available — cells and cables are different writes,
        and shuffling a row cannot disturb what joins it to another.

/**
 * Find a control by name, across every block at once.
 *
 * "Where does the presence live" has one good answer per preset and this is it.
 * Typing three letters beats opening four blocks in turn to look — and on a
 * phone each of those is a round trip to the Mac, so it beats it by more.
 *
 * THE LIST IS NOT BUILT UNTIL SOMEBODY ASKS FOR IT. Building it means reading
 * every block's controls, one at a time, and each of those is a slow read that
 * can make the unit dump its preset over serial. A find box nobody touches must
 * not cost that, so nothing happens until two letters are typed.
 *
 * AND IT SAYS WHAT IT IS DOING WHILE IT DOES IT. Seven of those reads on a
 * relay is several seconds, and a search box that sits there for several
 * seconds with no explanation is a search box that looks broken. It counts them
 * off instead.
 *
 * Results navigate rather than edit. Tapping one opens that block with the
 * control marked, so there stays exactly one place in this app where a value
 * changes, with its verified write behind it. And the tap is the end of the
 * search: the keyboard goes, the results go with it, and the page is left to
 * the block that opened — with the results still up and the keyboard still
 * over the bottom half, the block opened somewhere nobody could see.
